# MATLAB-Tools
Small but useful MATLAB programs that don't justify a standalone repo

## [GuiDisp](guidisp.m)
Because it's just too much effort to use msgbox and uiwait - much faster (and easier to remember) to just use guidisp for your message!
___Please remember that this will pause the running program until the user clicks on the "OK" button!___

## [cc](cc.m)
Another program that is quick and easy to type. Now easier than ever to quickly clear the workspace and the command window! Credit to [@Dr-Andy-French](https://github.com/Dr-Andy-French).
